# Mqtt-Connection-resources

In this repository you will find multiple resources that will help you getting started with MQTT using Arduino, Max, P5js etc...

MQTT is a internet protocol intended easily connect IoT devices together.

The protocol can run on low power hardware like Arduinos as well as on computer and it It has been implemented in many programming languages.

Simple MQTT use cases:
- One Arduino sends some data to one (or many) other Arduinos via an Internet connection.
- You want to send some data from Arduino to a p5.js or max msp program (or vice versa) via a wireless connection.

NOTES:
With MQTT you can only transfer data between nodes. If you need to store or save those data you will have to implement the saving mechanism yourself.

Some handy mqtt tutorials found on the Internet that you can use.
